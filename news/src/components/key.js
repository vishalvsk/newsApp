export const description = `Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology (IT) Rajeev Chandrasekhar said on September 21 that the Government of India is planning to make provisions for creating joint IPs between foreign companies and Indian start-ups.
The ministry said it is also working towards creating a space for AI and deep-tech start-ups not just through policies, but also by providing them capital support, market access, and preferential access to government contracts that would allow them to grow both financially and business-wise. Speaking at the Global Fintech Fest (GFF) 2022, Chandrasekhar said, "Everything the government is doing today will create a space for start-ups to be involved and inclusive. This is a model that will not be exclusionary to anyone." "We are also creating a space for Indian innovators in the AI and deep-tech segments, not only by means of policy, but all kinds of support, be it capital or market access," he added. Special access to datasets Chandrasekar said that the government is in the middle of creating one of the largest data set programmes which will enable access to anonymised and non-personal data on the platform for the entire AI ecosystem.
